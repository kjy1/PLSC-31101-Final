Back on December 10, former Big Bang member Seungri attended a 4th military court hearing session, where witnesses 'A', 'B', and 'C' appeared and gave testimonies regarding Seungri's allegations of solicitation of prostitution, procurement of prostitution,¬†and offering prostitution to clients.



On this day, witness 'B' stated in front of the court that she provided prostitution services in Seungri's home in September of 2019. 'B' said, ""I didn't know it was Seungri's house at first. I learned that it was Seungri's house when I arrived, and¬†Seungri was there. I¬†received my pay from a third party. Seungri also paid for the taxi which I used to return home.""



'B' additionally testified that she provided prostitution services for Seungri's Japanese client at a hotel in Yongsan, Seoul in December of 2015.¬†



However, Seungri's side denied these claims and refuted, ""It doesn't make sense that she learned the home was Seungri's home after arriving there. Seungri did not know that 'B' was a prostitute. Furthermore, in 2015, Seungri was a top singer and so he did not need any investment. He had no incentive to offer prostitution to Japanese investors.""¬†



Another witness 'C' similarly testified that she provided prostitution services at Seungri's home in December of 2015, but to the former Yuri Holdings president, Yoo In Suk. 'C' stated, ""I received the information from my seller and went to Seungri's home. I figured it was Seungri's home when I entered the first floor of the apartment. I had my gaze cast down when I entered, so I didn't know who all was there. There were about 3~4 men; I don't remember if Seungri was one of them. I do know that the buyer was Yoo In Suk.""Details of witness 'A's testimony, during which 'A' revealed that he participated in directing prostitutes to clients per orders received from Yoo In Suk, can be found here.¬†Meanwhile, a 5th court hearing will take place on December 29, centered around Seungri's charges of violating food sanitation laws and other business operation laws. Witnesses including former Monkey Museum employees will appear in front of the court.¬†","150","79%"

The netizen claimed that except for a few idol boy groups, most of the boy groups all wore dark clothing in the colors of black and red with dark makeup as the members glare at the camera.



The netizen also criticized how even their songs are all loud, upbeat songs that have mostly fast rap and extravagant performances with an overly strong concept. She claimed she became tired watching the performances as the boy groups showed a similar concept one after another.



She pointed out it's time that boy idols show off various concepts rather than just one. She suggested the boy groups try various concepts that are more fresh and light rather than dark.¬†The netizen explained she is not a fan of one particular idol group but was expressing her thoughts as she watched a music show.



On the post, there was divided opinion over this matter as netizens gave their thoughts in the heated discussion.



Netizens' Commented:

""So I wasn't the only one who felt that way. I'm a fan of girl groups but I definitely feel the same.""

""I totally agree, I think the concepts are more catering to the overseas market now.""

""I read the post and even the 'Road To Kingdom' show criticized the groups for doing the same concept.""

""I mean doing a fresh concept is easier said than done. It's no use if the group has no fandom.""

""I think BAP, Block B, Monsta X, and ATEEZ are enough groups with¬†a strong dark concept.""

""The Boyz did the fresh light concept for two years and they didn't gain any recognition.""

""The fresh light concept isn't that popular.""

""I think this person who made the post only saw a few performances, like 17 minutes of a 6-hour show.""

""I think they were pretty cool but they did all look the same.""

""I bet you people will complain if boy groups come out with the fresh light concept.""

Chung Ha confessed her reasons for working so hard by saying, ""I've heard this so many times, 'You have a lot on your mind? that means you have a lot of time. That's what it means to have time. Other people don't have time to think, and they just practice and face head-on.' So I thought, if I have a lot on my mind, that means I have a lot of time. I should just run without thinking and then I feel a sense of doubt. But then when I feel that way, I would think, 'I have too much leisure.'""



Chung Ha explained, ""There were times I would go perform at events day and night, film advertisements, then go abroad to perform, and do a live broadcast. There would be times that I would repeat this for a month without rest. I told myself, 'Don't think this is tiring and hard. This is something to be grateful for.' I always thought work was first since if I hurt when I dance, it would get better soon. I thought, 'I can't be lazy, or I can't protect my mom. If I stop, I will be dismissed.'""¬†and confessed her anxieties about taking a break.

Hani empathized with Chung Ha saying, ""It's like feeling that the leisure is laziness, so you have the feeling that you can't have time on your hands. You get obsessed with working and can't stop. I felt like that until I thought I could die like this. So I really thought I was in a dangerous state when I was like that.""

Chung Ha continued to speak about her condition, explaining she took a test to analyze her¬†subconscious thoughts. She explained, ""I took a subconscious test, the first thing that came up on my sub-conscience is that I want to feel like I'm breathing. After that is, I want to make music. I think it became difficult for me because I want to take a break and stop, but I can't at the same time,""¬†and began shedding tears.





Hani comforted Chung Ha, saying, ""How can a person keep running?""¬†Hani explained during an interview,¬†""My heart hurts because I feel like I'm seeing my old self. I was really upset.""¬†

The photos showed actors and actresses given private waiting rooms with their names on the door while there were some idol artists seen getting their hair and makeup done in the car as they waited in the parking lot.¬†After seeing the photos, other netizens agreed, saying, ""This is discrimination because actors were given waiting rooms, but singers were not.""¬†¬†Some posted photos¬†showed actors enjoying catering and taking photos of each other in the waiting room, which caused netizens to be more angered.

In addition, Seventeen posted photos of Jun waiting for the 2020 MAMA in the car on their official Twitter account. GOT7's Youngjae also released a photo of him waiting in the car at the award ceremony. Singers were seen in the parking lot standing outside while waiting for their turn.



Netizens who came across the news of this controversy commented,¬†""This is too much, they're making money off the singers,"" ""This is an award ceremony for singers, they should take care of the singers more,"" ""Are the actors and actresses some royal family or something?"" ""The singers came to receive awards. I think giving waiting rooms to singers might be much better. It's a music award show after all,""¬†and ""Is being an actor and actress that special?""

Billboard, the U.S. music media outlet, released 'The 50 Best Albums of 2020: Staff Picks' on December 7th, in which BLACKPINK's first full-length album ranked 25th place, which is the highest rank among K-Pop albums so far.¬†Billboard praised 'The Album' as they said the title was fitting for the girl group's first album. They stated, "" Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Ros√© offer up eight thrilling doses of grade-A K-pop perfection, from the hip-hop swagger of thunderous lead single ‚ÄúHow You Like That‚Äù to the infectious shout-along dance-pop of ‚ÄúLovesick Girls.""



The article continued to praise the album by¬†saying, ""The Album not only builds on the foursome‚Äôs string of hits since their 2016 debut, but it also provides the perfect entry point for soon-to-be Blinks to embrace the girls as they continue their meteoric rise.""

Meanwhile, BLACKPINK has gained an unrivaled position in the global music market with their vigorous activities this year. Starting from¬†the release of their new song ""Sour Candy,"" a collaboration with the pop star Lady Gaga, in May¬†followed by the release of ""How You Like That"" in June, ""Ice Cream"" in August, then 'The Album' in October, BLACKPINK has kept a busy year.

BLACKPINK wrote a new history for K-pop girl groups as each song they released received immense recognition. Among the songs released this year, ""How You Like That"" was picked as 'Song of The Summer' in the '2020 MTV Video Music Awards' in August, while, 'The Album' ranked second place in both the U.S. Billboard 200 and U.K's Official Albums Chart for eight and seven¬†consecutive weeks, respectively.Thanks to this remarkable achievement, BLACKPINK is receiving spotlight from the year-end award ceremonies both in South Korea and overseas, including the leading media outlets.","39","69%"

Furious K-Pop fans are also discussing some of the past issues raised against Mnet's signature year-end music ceremony, the 'Mnet Asian Music Awards'.¬†



Some have previously called the 'Mnet Asian Music Awards' the ""moneymaker"" of CJ ENM, Mnet's parent company. During the '2019 MAMA' ceremony last year, fans of K-Pop artists were charged 238,670 KRW (~ $220 USD) for a seat at the Nagoya Dome in Japan, as well as an additional 54,630 KRW (~ $50 USD) if they wanted to see the red carpet event. All 30,000 tickets for the '2019 MAMA' were sold out by the event date, earning CJ ENM a total of 7,160,100,000 (~ $6.6 million USD).¬†



However, K-Pop artists who perform at the 'MAMA' ceremonies do not receive any payment for their appearance, outside of flight tickets and lodging during their overseas schedule. Some entertainment industry insiders have criticized the fact that 'MAMA' makes a profit from ticket sales when none of the profits go to the K-Pop artists, whose fans are the primary ticket buyers.¬†







Furthermore, actors and actresses who are invited to the 'MAMA's (usually always overseas) also received additional special treatment in the form of exclusive invitations to a private afterparty. During the years when 'MAMA' was held in Hong Kong, the luxurious afterparties which took place at a sky bar at a top hotel were famous; however, most K-Pop idols are not invited to this afterparty, as many of them are¬†spending sleepless days and nights preparing for the flood of year-end music show schedules. As a result, most K-Pop idols fly back to Korea immediately after the end of the main 'MAMA' ceremony.¬†



On the other hand, many actors and actresses who attend 'MAMA' as award givers are often personally invited by CJ ENM's well-known vice president, Lee Mi Kyung. The 'MAMA' afterparty, according to insiders, is an event where actors and actresses establish and maintain connections with high-ranking CJ ENM officials. Ordinary staff including celebrities' managers, the press, and civilians are forbidden from entering the afterparty. K-Pop artists who do attend the afterparty are often asked to perform for the crowd, as Big Bang is known to have done during their 'MAMA' attendances.¬†







Lastly, netizens noted that K-Pop artists who receive little to no pay during year-end music ceremonies and festivals, often spend well around several billion KRW¬†(1 billion KRW = approximately 1 million USD) of their own funding for hair, makeup, clothing, accessories, stage setup, VCR filming, and more. Artists from ""small agencies who don't have money can't even go on the year-end shows"", some netizens claimed.¬†



In light of the recent controversy surrounding K-Pop idols' mistreatment at the '2020 MAMA' this past weekend, fans left furious comments such as:

Mnet has issued a statement of response against fans' harsh criticism of the '2020 Mnet Asian Music Awards'. Recently, images of attending performing artists who were spotted waiting in the parking lot, in their vehicles, and more while waiting to perform have stirred up controversy on online communities. The controversy pointed to the fact that while performing K-Pop artists were stationed in parking lots, attending actors and actresses designated as award givers were provided with separate waiting rooms and catering.¬†



One representative of Mnet told media outlets on December 8, ""There were only two buildings which had completed construction at the Pachu Contents World, where the '2020 MAMA' took place. If we were to provide everyone in attendance with separate waiting rooms, we needed multiple buildings; but realistically, this was not possible as there were not enough completed buildings. Furthermore, we could not ask people to wait in far off locations as it was a live broadcast, and so we had to inevitably ask performing artists to wait in the parking lot to keep up with COVID19 prevention measures.""¬†



The rep continued, ""In the case of the performing artists, their stages were carried out with pre-recording methods so they had already been inside the building, and on the day of the event there were no stages so there were no rehearsals either. So we asked the musicians for their understanding in advance. The musicians were asked to wait in the parking lot until they were the next next up, and then they entered the building and used a few available waiting rooms before going on stage. The award givers did not have prior knowledge of the building and so they needed more time to run through scripts and memorize the event process. There were not as many award givers and so they could be contained in one building per COVID19 prevention measures, and so to prevent close contact in one space, the waiting rooms were divided as such.""



Finally, the rep remarked, ""There was catering available for both musicians and award givers. For the musicians, they could access the catering while waiting in rooms which were¬†available to them before going on stage.""¬†



Nonetheless, it's suspected that the broadcasting station's controversial approach to the situation, and netizens' strong criticism, will not subside any time soon.¬†","32","78%"

Viewers are wondering why this particular song did not win as many awards than expected.



Any song come to mind? Currently, netizens are talking about Zico's ""Any¬†Song"" and how its superb records this year on music charts have not earned its recognition in award shows.





On an online community forum, a netizen noted that this song was ""#1 in the comprehensive chart out of all the songs this year,"" and yet it only won an award as part of the 'Top 10' on¬†'2020 Melon Music Awards'. The netizen also wrote, ""I understand how BTS can win Daesang because there's the critics' component. But, how can it not win in the hip-hop category?""









Among the netizens, another debate arose in which why BTS's ""Dynamite"" was not the recipient in the same category,¬†as neither ""Any Song"" nor ""Dynamite"" but ""Immado"" by DAMOIM took the honor. While some stated that ""Dynamite"" deserved the win even in that category against ""Any Song"", others argued that Zico's song was clearly the projected winner¬†based on the category's yearly chart.



With BTS's ""Dynamite"" setting a new record on 'Melon' as the longest-running #1 song in a row, the debate ultimately became one that questioned whether the song should receive¬†specific recognition within the hip-hop category as well as¬†the Daesang.





On the other hand, while¬†Zico's ""Any Song""¬†did win in the Hip Hop & Urban Music category in '2020 MAMA', netizens are still wondering why it still has¬†not yet received a wider recognition in award shows overall. What are your thoughts?

Previously, there was a controversy over the 2020 Mnet Asian Music Awards as actors and actresses invited to present the awards were given waiting rooms with catering while the artists had to wait in their cars in the parking lot.¬†



Since then, Korean netizens have raised their voices to give an opinion that the grand prize should be presented by veteran and legendary artists. There were instances in which veteran and legendary singers presented the grand award such as the 2017 Melon Music Awards and the 2019 Mnet Asian Music Awards.

Then in 2019, BTS had the honor of being presented the grand prize at the 2019 MAMA by the legendary singer-songwriter Shin Seung Hoon.

Likewise, many netizens stated that the award ceremonies would be much more meaningful if the veteran and legendary artists were able to present the awards to their junior artists.



Netizens commented in an online community, ""I totally agree, I never understood by actors were invited to a music award ceremony to present the awards,"" ""They should invite the senior artists to give the award to the junior artists, that would be much more meaningful,"" ""That is so true,"" ""Last year, when BTS got the award from Shin Seung Hoon, I felt a flutter inside,"" ""Totally agree that artists giving the award to their junior is much more meaningful than actors who have no relation to them giving the award,""¬†and ""They need to have more singers present the award at music award ceremonies.""","17","84%"

During this hearing, a close friend of Seungri 'A', also a member of Seungri's problematic Kakao chat room, appeared as a witness in front of the military court.

I offered 'A' assistance because 'A's dream was to become an actor. 'A's parents were also fond of me.""¬†



Seungri then recollected the events which took place shortly after the 'Burning Sun' news made headlines. According to Seungri, there was a significant amount of pressure from the police during the initial¬†stages of questioning.¬†



Seungri then asked 'A' why they allowed the police to file reports which contradicted 'A's statements.

At times, you think, 'That was real' or 'That was probably realistic', and such and you hope that it comes across as real; at other times, it feels like you are just fulfilling the function of an actor.

[Content Warning: sexual assault, child abuse, violence]



A cellmate of the infamous child sex offender Cho Doo Soon shared his experience after spending a considerable amount of time¬†with the individual in the same room.



According to an article on 'Money Today', a JTBC program visited the prison where Cho Doo Soon currently remains. During an interview with his cellmate, the producers found out that the infamous sex offender was in an extremely vigorous physical condition with increasing muscle mass and¬†a high level of libido. As of this year, Cho Doo Soon is aged 68.



Despite his age-based senior status, Cho Doo Soon was revealed to be able to do 1,000 push-ups a day and that he masturbates after allegedly being ""affected by electromagnetic waves coming from the CCTV and TV.""



According to Dr. Shin Eui Jin, the doctor who is also in charge of the child victim's conditions, Cho is still dealing with an ""excessively high level of libido,""¬†and that what worries everyone is his capacity to ""overact"". Furthermore, his reference to the electromagnetic waves is considered to be¬†a psychological justification for his sexual acts, based on Dr. Shin's observations.





Upon seeing this news, netizens expressed their disbelief that this prisoner would be soon released, even after being diagnosed with such abnormal conditions. In fact, the release date of Cho has been moved up a day; instead of the scheduled December 13, he will be officially released on the 12th.¬†



Some comments include:



""If he had received life imprisonment from the onset, then we wouldn't have had to deal with this problem in the first place.""

""I have a daughter, so this hits home. Shouldn't he at least be castrated?""

""I'm sure once he's out they are gonna protect his privacy, which means other people are still at risk. For whom does the law function?""

The debate topic that recently gave netizens some big laughs, the ""butt""¬†debate started by GFriend, has spread to other girl groups like Cosmic Girls and (G)I-DLE!



During a recent 'Dingo Music' video, the GFriend members got in a fiery debate about whether or not the ""butt""¬†is one body part, or two body parts. SinB strongly argued that the ""butt"" is in fact two body parts, categorized into the left ""butt""¬†and the right ""butt"".¬†







Somehow, the question ended up being asked during Cosmic Girls member Eunseo's recent 'V Live'!



Eunseo: the ""butt""¬†is one.

Yeoreum:¬†the ""butt""¬†is two.



????







The girls then called Luda to ask another's opinon.



Luda:¬†the ""butt""¬†is one!



Meanwhile,¬†fans during the 'V¬†Live': SinB had a debate about this recently.¬†





Eunseo: Really? Then let me call her!

(Eunseo and SinB are known to be good friends.)¬†

SinB: You know, the ""butt""¬†is actually two. Wait, are you saying it's one? Then you better hang up.

Eunseo:¬†??????

SinB: Don't call me again until you change your mind and start believing that the ""butt""¬†is two.¬†







Next, Eunseo called up (G)I-DLE's Soojin.

(Eunseo, SinB, and Soojin are known to share a bff group chat room.)



Soojin: What kind of question is this??? Do I really have to answer?

Soojin: I think it's two.¬†

Eunseo: What's wrong with these two!!!!!





Cut to another recent 'V¬†Live' broadcast featuring (G)I-DLE's Soojin and Miyeon.¬†





Soojin: SinB says that because the ""breast""¬†is also two, the ""butt"" is two.

Miyeon: I personally think that both the ""breast""¬†and the ""butt""¬†are one. But probably if you really get scientific about it, two might be more logical.¬†





(Netizens say the two debated about this topic for a good while during this live.)





Fan, to (G)I-DLE's Yuqi:¬†Do you think the ""butt""¬†is one or two?

Yuqi:¬†Since there is a left and a right, I think two.

Shuhua:¬†Why would a ""butt"" be two?¬†They're connected, so it's one.¬†

Yuqi:¬†Wow, this is a great question!







And finally, the question has even made its way into Weki Meki member Choi Yoo Jung's Q&A!

Although he was born ten days earlier than expected, he was born healthy, weighing in at 3.2 kg (7 lbs).¬†Sayuri started her broadcasting career in Korea in 2007 after appearing on KBS's 'Global Talk Show.' Since then, she made various appearances on television and broadcast shows as she rose in fame.Last October, Sayuri visited an obstetrics and gynecology clinic in Korea because of her irregular menstruation. Then she had heard the shocking news that her ovary is at the condition of a¬†48-year-old. She was told that natural pregnancy would be difficult, and even In vitro fertilization would be difficult.Sayuri was known to want children as she mentioned multiple times on television that she had even frozen her eggs. Sayuri stated in a telephone interview with KBS, ""The doctor said that natural pregnancy would be difficult for me and the chances of the test-tube pregnancy would be low as well. I felt like my world was falling apart. I even felt like dying. The doctor told me it would get worse as time passes and I won't be able to have children at all in my lifetime.""¬†Sayuri had wanted to have a baby for a long time but was out of options. She stated, ""The first thing I can think of that I can do was marriage. But then I didn't want to hastily find someone to marry just because I wanted a child. I also didn't want to marry someone I don't love. Therefore, I decided to become a mother without getting married.""



However, it was not easy for Sayuri to voluntarily become a single mother. This is because it is difficult to find a hospital that will give sperm donations to women who are not married. Therefore, Sayuri decided to go to Japan and go through the process of becoming pregnant.



After deciding to become a single mother, Sayuri has revealed her process. Sayuri stated she is delighted that she was able to give birth, and seems like a dream.



Sayuri also stated she wanted to reveal all her process of becoming a single mother because she wants to be a proud single mother and to deliver the message of support to all single mothers. She stated, she wants single mothers not to be frowned upon or looked down on anymore but to be acknowledged in Korea.



Many netizens are supporting the TV personality as they comment, ""Sayuri, you are awesome,"" ""It must have been a hard choice, but I support you,"" ""I really think you can be respected for your decision."",¬†and ""I hope all things go well with you and your child.

On November 12, Seoul's Supreme Court ordered singer/actor Kim Hyun Joong's ex-girlfriend 'A' to pay the star 100 million KRW (~ 90,000 USD) plus additional damage costs for defamation of character.¬†



The first legal battle between Kim Hyun Joong and his ex-girlfriend occured back in August of 2014, when 'A' filed a lawsuit against Kim Hyun Joong for physical assault, resulting in damages to 6 of her ribs. The lawsuit came to an end after Kim Hyun Joong promised to address the press with a formal statement of apology toward 'A', paid 'A' 600 million KRW (~ 540,000 USD) in damages, and 'A' promised secrecy regarding the issue. Kim Hyun Joong was additionally charged with physical assault and fined 5 million KRW.



Then, in April of 2015, 'A' filed another lawsuit against Kim Hyun Joong, claiming that due to Kim Hyun Joong's physical assault, she had a miscarriage. 'A' also claimed that Kim Hyun Joong's side attempted to force her into getting an abortion.¬†In July of the same year, Kim Hyun Joong filed a counter lawsuit against 'A' for violation of their previous court contract, as well as defamation of character.¬†



In the middle of the lawsuit, 'A' gave birth to Kim Hyun Joong's son in September of 2015. It's reported that 'A' is currently raising the child on her own, with Kim Hyun Joong forbidden from seeing him.¬†

No one recognized her on the street when I was with her.""‚ÄïWhat is the reason you asked for the money after giving it to her?¬†‚ÄúWe were close enough to meet two to three times a week after we started talking on Instagram. She told me she needed 5 million KRW (~4,500¬†USD)¬†because of her mother. So I sent her the money. Then I kept sending her money for food, living expenses, she was asking me for 50,000 KRW and 100,000 KRW. There was a time I couldn't wire her money anymore, so I even gave her a credit card. Then she told me that her company is moving so I got her a studio apartment near her new company. That's how¬†I spent 50 million KRW. I did like her as a woman, but I just wanted her to be successful as a singer. I lent her the money under the condition that she doesn't cause trouble or gets involved in things like prostitution. I told her to pay me back after she becomes successful as a singer. That's when the problem became serious and she started drinking more and asked me to lend her more money.""

‚ÄïCurrently, Hyeme stated she would be taking stern legal action against your claim, where you said she used her studio apartment as a secret location to date men.""The condition to me lending her money was she would not cause trouble. But then there was an issue at the studio apartment, so I mentioned that. I have Kakaotalk conversations as evidence. I don't want to have a dirty mud fight, but I will reveal it if I have no other choice.""‚ÄïYou are an ordinary company/salaryman. Isn't 50 million KRW too much money?¬†""I found out that Hyeme was a celebrity and she even said, 'would I scam money and run away when I'm a celebrity?' She told me she would pay me back and I thought she was young, so no way she couldn't pay that money back. I thought she was pretty and had potential as an idol. I just wanted her to do well without any distractions like worrying about money.""‚ÄïHyeme is claiming that you didn't lend her the money but voluntarily gave it to her.‚ÄúI have Kakaotalk messages of every time she asked¬†me for 50,000 KRW and 100,000 KRW. I did not voluntarily give it to her. I didn't even include the money I sent her through star balloons. I only counted the money that she asked to borrow. We weren't dating and she didn't like me as a man, so her thinking I'm just giving her the money is a misunderstanding on her part.""



‚ÄïHyeme is claiming that you kept asking her to sleep with you; that's why she avoided your calls. She argued that she didn't intentionally avoid you or try to scam you.

""I never asked her to sleep with me. This can be verified by one of our acquaintances who used to hang out with us. I knew Hyeme wasn't interested in me. I was more careful when I knew she wasn't interested in me and also told her to be careful. Also, if we had that kind of issue, I wouldn't be able to file a legal complaint against her, and I wouldn't be able to talk to the media confidently. Also, if someone was afraid of a sex request, would they be able to ask that person for money for over a year? I'm also planning to file a lawsuit for defamation for falsely accusing me of asking her for sex. If she sues me for sexual harassment, I will counter sue Hyeme.""‚ÄïHyeme claimed that you came to her apartment without contacting her first and said that you invaded her privacy.

""She said I got her that apartment, but I don't even know the password to the door lock. I can't invade her privacy. There were only two reasons for me going to her - I went to her to give her food after contacting her or when she contacted me to tell me to come and drink with her.""‚ÄïWhy did you sponsor her for such a long time even after knowing she didn't have feelings for you?""As I mentioned before, I loaned the money to her. I didn't give it¬†to her. I kept a record of all the money because I gave her the money with the condition that she would pay it¬†back. Also, even after knowing she didn't have feelings for me, Hyeme would send kind messages to me and send me her pictures. So I believed she was giving me a chance. Also, we met two to three times a week with this kind of relationship for about two years. I grew fond of her too. But we grew apart because of drinking issues and she kept asking me to lend her money.""‚ÄïHow did you feel after seeing Hyeme's response?""I've been providing evidence every time I make a claim. When I felt the evidence was insufficient, I called on witnesses to prove it. But, Hyeme is making me into a criminal but has not shown any evidence. I want to see the evidence to her claims.""","98","86%"

Netizens worldwide were shocked to hear that the members from popular project groups such as Wanna One, X1, and IZ*ONE¬†were chosen from manipulated votes. Just two days ago, the list of the names of the contestants who were unfairly disqualified from the four seasons of 'Produce 101' was released, bringing more commotion to the controversy.



Although the names of the contestants who were disqualified were released, the names of the trainees who benefited from the vote manipulation were not disclosed. The court stated they will not release the names of the trainees who received help from the vote manipulation because it can bring about unnecessary hate towards the idol group members.



Recently, one netizen posted on an online community¬†various photos of the IZ*ONE. The netizen claimed that the members look unhappy. Other netizens speculated that the reason is that the members were unhappy after they found out the group was composed of the members chosen from vote manipulation.



Fans were sad to see the girls look dejected and¬†Korean netizens commented on various speculated reasons why the girls may seem unhappy, while some argued against those claims.



Netizens' Comments:

""I would be ashamed too if I found out that the group was from manipulated votes.""

""This is sad that they look dejected.""

""They probably are unhappy because of the list that was revealed.""

""I mean, how can you be happy 265 days a year? Stop saying ridiculous things.""

""Are you guys also always happy when you're at work?""

""How can they be happy in a situation like this one?""

""It's just the photos that were taken in one moment. The girls are probably looking happier in other photos.""

Two trainees, Go Yoo Jin and Lee In Soo, appeared to talk about the show's behind-the-scenes story.¬†When asked, ""Were you aware that the show was rigged while filming?""¬†Go Yoo Jin replied, ""Yes, I felt it a lot.""¬†She stated¬†that she felt there were times when the staff were not interested in certain trainees. She confessed,¬†""I felt 'oh those staff members are not really interested in me.' They would only film the same set of people.""Then she added, ""The trainees from Season 3 were saying 'but this is rigged' and there is probably no trainee who really expected anything since they all were thinking 'This is rigged,' 'it's rigged again'.""

Former trainee Lee In Soo mentioned that not all trainees were given a chance to be in¬†the 'Ghost Hidden Camera' content of Produce 101, in which he knew the contestants to be picked were already set. He criticized, ""They should not have filmed it at all or give everyone the same chance to be on it. They could have filmed all the trainees and only picked the ones who were funny, but some trainees weren't even given a chance to be filmed.""



According to Lee In Soo, there were outcasts among the trainees. There were even moments when the trainees nearly got into physical fights, but when the cameras turned on, the contestants' attitudes would all suddenly change. So the fighting subsided as soon as the cameras started rolling.¬†Lee In Soo also revealed that certain agencies were able to exercise certain powers. When one trainee from an agency thought that the cameras weren't working well, the producers replaced all the cameras on set with lenses that would give him a wider view.



In addition, the two former trainees openly talked about the untold stories while being a trainee. When asked if they would participate in the 'Produce' show again, both replied with a ""Yes.""¬†Lee In Soo joked, ""I'll ask my mom to prepare 20 million KRW,""¬†while Go Yoo Jin replied, ""I want to participate again because it was fun, but I don't want to debut as a celebrity.""¬†

It was previously announced that Big Hit Entertainment will hold the '2021 New Year's Eve Live' concert presented by Weverse. The concert was announced to take place at the KINTEX hall in Gyeonggi Province from 9:30 PM on December 31st. The concert will also provide online live streaming.The artist line up in the joint concert includes BTS along with NU'EST of Pledis Entertainment, TXT, Lee Hyun, GFriend of Source Music, and even ENHYPEN, the new group from an audition program.This is the first offline concert that BTS will be part of since the COVID19 pandemic made it difficult for live concerts. Moreover, other agencies such as¬†SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, and YG Entertainment held many joint concerts previously but this is the first concert that Big Hit Entertainment is hosting with all the artists of their label. Big Hit Entertainment expressed its intention to expand the concert by holding an annual New Year countdown concert with fans.However, Korean BTS fans have not reacted kindly to this year's joint concert. Fans have stated various reasons for their dissatisfaction with the concert. Some of the BTS fans, the ARMY, have even declared to boycott the Big Hit Label concert. The petition does not represent the opinion of all the BTS fans but many of the Korean fans agree with the content of the boycott statement.

First, fans have complained that the long-awaited offline concert was not a solo concert but a joint concert.Fans failed to accept the imperativeness of the label's joining concert. Fans have stated, ""The artists of the Big Hit label are not the artists who are part of the same company and have been working together for a long time like the other agencies. The artists are part of separate agencies that are just affiliates and¬†have recently been merged for business. Not only do the singers, but the fans also do not recognize the artists of Big Hit label as the artist of the same company. The fans believe this joint concert is only for media attention.""Some¬†fans also took issue with the excessively high ticket prices. Big Hit Entertainment included three packages, all in different price ranges.¬†Tickets are on sale for 154,000 KRW (~138.15 USD) for the base 'Live Package.' The 'CONNECT Package,' includes the tickets for soundcheck and red carpet entrance for 242,000 KRW (~217.10 USD), and the 'WE'VE package' includes the concert ticket, soundcheck, and red carpet entrance, and a 'FUN Kit' for 275,000 KRW (~246.70 USD). The contents of the 'FUN Kit' has not yet been revealed.These fans have stated they have never seen any ticket priced this high before. They stated, ""The Big Hit label concert ticket price is 270,000 KRW at most. We have not seen any ticket - either from BTS's concerts or any other artists' concerts, even joint concerts - priced this high.""¬†The Korean ARMYs have stated they do not want¬†to pay the high priced ticked when they do not know how long BTS will be performing during the joint concert. Also, the fans pointed out another issue that the expensive concert tickets are only available to official fan club members and will be sold through a lottery system.Fans opposed the concert stating, ""The fans only believe the joint concert is being hosted for media attention. Fans feel BTS and the ARMYs are being only used with that intent.""Now many people are focusing their attention on whether Big Hit Entertainment will be able to resolve the conflict with fans and hold this label concert under good atmosphere on the last day of the year 2020.","105","71%"

There is no disagreement between the ruling and opposition parties; therefore, they finally¬†came to a resolution on how to select the exceptional pop culture candidates. Artists who have received a National Certificate of Merit can be considered for the delay in¬†enlistment.Recently, BTS released their new album 'BE' and held a global press conference on November 20th.



During the press conference, BTS members made it clear that all the members will fulfill their mandatory military service.



BTS members are to join the military starting next year; however, there is a way for the group to promote as a complete group longer.



The National Assembly's Defense Commission passed a revision to the military service law, called the 'BTS Military Service Act.'



The current military service law stipulates that those who can delay the military service or military enlistment are the individuals who contributed their excellence in the field of sports. However, the new amendment includes individuals who have raised the national status in the field of pop culture and art.



There has not been a disagreement between the ruling and opposition parties. Therefore, there is a high possibility that the plenary session will pass the new act.

Within six months of passing the plenary session, the enforcement ordinance of the Military Service Law should be revised. However,¬†the government and political circles are considering delaying the enlistment of the pop culture artists who have received medals, National Certificate of Merit, and¬†presidential commendations. These individuals can delay their enlistment¬†until they are 30 years old.BTS already received the Hwagwan Order of Cultural Merit two years ago for increasing the popularity of the K-Culture and the Korean Language¬†around the world.Many netizens commented that the law should pass and some even commented that BTS should be fully exempt from serving in the military due to their accomplishments and spreading Korean culture globally. They argued that BTS's impact worldwide contributes a lot more to Korea¬†than an athlete winning¬†a gold medal.

Recently, an ongoing online dispute between Korean and Chinese netizens over the origins of Korean culture is garnering attention as a heated topic of debate.¬†



Particularly, the issue of Chinese netizens claiming that Korea's traditional hanbok originates from China has angered numerous K-netizens.¬†



One well-known Weibo influencer recently garnered attention as she claimed that Korea's hanbok was basically the same as China's hanfu, arguing that ""It is obvious Korea's hanbok took inspiration from China's hanfu. When countries are situated in close proximity to one another, they can't help but influence the other.""¬†







In another instance, an actor of an upcoming Chinese drama shared a post on his SNS in an outfit which confused many people, as it was difficult to distinguish whether or not the style was hanbok or hanfu. In response, a producer of the drama commented, ""Of course it is hanfu. Korean hanbok is just a copy of Chinese hanfu that officials from the Goryeo dynasty took and used as Goryeo was a tribunary state of Ming China.""



(There are still rampant historical debates about whether ancient¬†Korean kingdoms such as Goryeo, Koguryeo, and Joseon were ""tribunary states"" of China.)







A¬†popular Chinese mobile game called 'Shining Key' also enraged Korean netizens, shortly after launching in Korea and incorporating Korean hanbok styles in character designs.¬†



Chinese netizens first voiced their protests, claiming that hanbok originated from China and demanding explanation/action from the game company .



In response to Chinese netizens' complaints, the game company halted all service of the game in Korea, stating, ""We will uphold the dignity of our nation as a Chinese company.""¬†







In Korea, analysts have brought up the theory that China is attacking Korean culture, including Korea's hanbok, based on emotions of jealousy, rage, and inferiority. So called the 'Steal Korean Culture Movement' by Korean analysts, issues such as China's claims that hanbok is Chinese, Chinese netizens' criticism toward K-Pop artists like BTS, BLACKPINK, and more are being perceived in Korea as behaviors of jealousy.¬†







One scholar commented, ""BTS filmed their performances outside of Kyungbuk Palace. Other artists such as BLACKPINK wore hanbok while performing on international stages. Korean hanbok is garnering massive attention due to K-Pop and Hallyu, but the Chinese can't help but notice how similar these things are to Chinese culture. It seems that to China, they cannot endure seeing Korea overtaking them in terms of cultural outreach, when in the past, China was the superior force.""¬†

The increasing number of Chinese people purchasing properties in Korea is causing real estate market instability.¬†In fact, there has been an increasing number of Chinese landowners in Korea. The number of Chinese landowners has increased by a factor of 14 times in 8 years.In total land area,¬†Chinese people own land that is six times larger than Yeouido.Shin Kyo Eon, a real estate professor at Konkuk University, stated, ""The problem is that the purchasing rate has increased. There is a lot of concerns that housing prices in certain areas are soaring. There needs to be measures taken against foreigners buying property and land.""Critics point out that the proportion of Chinese people among all foreign landowners has increased vastly. Currently, political circles have begun to push for a bill that could partially restrict foreign real estate purchases in Korea. There has even been a petition given to the presidential office at the Blue House about this matter.According to the bill obtained by Korea Economic TV, Article 7 of the Real Estate Transaction Reporting Act itself is set as a presidential decree.



Previously, the acquisition of 'land' by foreigners could be restricted under the current law, but it was not included in the Presidential Decree in accordance with the reciprocity between countries. Mutualism is a diplomatic term that takes the same action between countries; however, Korean citizens¬†cannot own land in China.

Hong Seok Joon, a member of the National Assembly of the People's Power, stated, ""The Chinese landowners can greatly affect the housing prices. In actuality, there are no regulations on owning foreign real estate. In International Law, the greatest principle is reciprocity. However, there is an indefinite concept of ownership when it comes to the Chinese people.""Rep. Hong also plans to apply the same level of regulations to the real estate transactions of foreigners¬†as the Korean people in the domestic real estate transactions.



The plan is to expand the land transaction permit system, which limits the sale to foreigners if they do not actually live in the property, and impose an additional heavy tax rate on the current acquisition tax rate when foreigners purchase houses.



Rep.¬†Hong Seok Joon stated, ""There is a need to change the law so that we can regulate transactions from land to apartments and houses.¬†There's no need to discriminate against people overseas to those¬†in Korea. However, currently, the housing laws are structured to benefit foreigners much more than Koreans in Korea.""

Due to the government's strict regulations on real estate, the dream of owning a home for many Koreans is becoming unreachable.



The measure to prevent foreigners from acquiring speculative properties is likely to be put on the back burner, but this will¬†spread controversy over discrimination among Koreans.","61","89%"

Another popular program has shocked netizens as it has been revealed that three members of a girl group fromis_9 were changed out by vote manipulation.The producer in charge (CP)¬†of Mnet's audition program 'Idol School,' which aired in 2017, reportedly admitted to manipulating the votes during his first trial.Kim Sung Hoon, the senior judge at the Seoul Central District Court, held the first trial of CP Kim and CJENM director Kim, who were handed over to trial on charges of obstruction of business and fraud.On November 9, CP Kim's lawyer¬†acknowledged all the facts but legally claimed innocence. He claimed, ""We have no excuse for causing damage to viewers who voted with affection for the cast. However, the cast members were ranked in a different way than was originally notified to the audience. The defendant is claiming¬†innocence whether he¬†can be punished for obstruction of business and fraud.""CP Kim stated, ""The text votes were supposed to weigh ten times the normal vote. However, distortion occurred because there were only a few text votes and also low viewer ratings. We saw that there was a sharp rise in the ranking of certain performers as their families mobilized other family members, relatives, and acquaintances to vote. We felt if we keep at it, we will lose more viewer ratings, and the program will fail. So we weighed the online votes to weigh five times as much as well.""

He added, ""It's not that we didn't reflect the text votes at all. We just weighed the online votes to be five times more."" CP Kim continued to state that he wonders if this can be seen as manipulating and deceiving the viewers.Director Kim of CJENM denied the entire indictment. Director Kim's lawyer stated, ""The prosecution believed that the defendant decided to exclude contestants from the final selection by discussing the elimination of certain cast members ahead of the 11th live broadcast with CP Kim. However, he does not have any recollection of the incident.¬†There were 16 programs managed at the time, but the director did not have the time to engage and discuss in detail¬†certain programs. CP Kim and the main producers have the authority to decide the composition and edition of the broadcast programs.""Earlier, Kim CP was put on trial for obstructing CJENM's broadcasting production work by manipulating the rankings of 33 people and selecting three members who did not make the final ranking to be part of the debut group on September 22, 2017.He is also accused of collecting 15 million KRW (~$13,411) in profits from about 69,000 viewers and 3 million KRW (~$2,700)¬†in profits from a settlement after lying to viewers¬†that they can decide on the debut group¬†through a paid text vote from July 20 to September 22.The prosecution judged that director Kim received a report from CP Kim when selecting the debut member for the last episode and approved it. Prosecutors¬†handed Director Kim over to trial on charges of conspiracy.

Meanwhile, their next trial is scheduled for January 14 of next year.

It was reported that she had recently set a record of 20 billion KRW (~18 million USD) in annual sales during the year 2019. In August of 2014, Jessica launched her fashion brand named 'Blanc & Eclaire.' Starting with sunglasses, she has released various fashion items through her brand and is still expanding on her collection.¬†

Jessica is often seen overseas rather than in Korea because she loves to travel and also resides abroad most of the time.

While on business trips overseas, Jessica uploads the scenery that she misses while being in Korea. Recently, she is seen back in Korea and traveling around the country. She uploaded photos of the Busan coast and shared her hotel's beautiful view, making many curious about which hotel she had resided in Busan.

It was revealed that Jessica stayed at the 'Grand Chosun Hotel' in Busan, which was newly opened after remodeling the old Novotel from Shinsegae. The hotel is known to be located right in front of Haeundae Beach, located five minutes away from Haeundae Station Exit 3, making the hotel easily accessible.The nearby SEA LIFE Busan Aquarium is a one-minute walk away and Nurimaru APEC House is about five minutes' drive away. It has 330 rooms with 16 floors above ground and 4 basement floors, four food and beverage businesses, swimming pools, fitness and spa, and banquet event rooms.



Jessica can also be seen staying at luxurious hotels abroad as well. In the photos uploaded to Instagram in February, Jessica was seen taking a picture at a hotel in Paris.¬†

This hotel that Jessica was staying at¬†is Le Meurice in Paris. Le Meurice is a luxury hotel located across from Tulli Park, 1st District in Paris. Le Meurice, which opened in 1835, was renovated last year. Through the hands of Philippe Starck, a world-renowned French designer, Louis XVI's luxurious and modern elegance has been redesigned. Each floor is decorated with different themes that are enjoyable to the eye.France is a city of art and culture. The only way to meet all expectations at once is to experience a night at a hotel that has been awarded a 'Palaces' rating. Le Meurice is one of the few hotels that has earned a Palaces rating. So far, only 25 hotels in France have been ranked in the Palaces category.

The location of Le Meurice, filled with the fragrance of art, is also perfect.

f(x)'s Krystal talked about the difference in her body weight as an actress.



In a recent interview, Krystal opened up about her debut image as a girl group idol. She expressed that she used to be¬†incredibly thin, but that¬†the nature of her work back then had¬†naturally kept that weight maintenance.



""When you work as a singer, you're extremely busy and tired so that you naturally lose your appetite. There's a reason why they are thin. I used to be really thin. But if I had this weight back then, I wouldn't have been considered beautiful,"" said Krystal.



However, she also added that she never had a negative feeling about having debuted at an early age. Krystal was only sixteen-years-old when she made her debut, but she says that there were ""many positives"" to having entered the field as a young person.¬†



""There were many things I¬†learned by entering the society early on. I was able to start early, do it for a long time, and meet great people while staying in contact with my schoolmates. I used to be extremely shy back then, but my work also helped me overcome that barrier,"" said the idol-actress.¬†""When people used to¬†recognize me while I was eating tteokbokki, I would simply nod and smile (laughs).""



In a positive manner, Krystal concluded that she did ""everything that she could do as a student"" back then. In related news, Krystal recently made her big-screen debut through the film 'More Than Family', playing the role of¬†a pregnant college student.

Kim Yuna has become a legend as she gained the title of figure-skating¬†Queen becoming the first female figure skater to break the 200 points mark. She has been loved by the nation of Korea and became the role model for many young girls and boys.



Kim Yuna was known to practice 8 hours a day improving the artistry and technique of figure skating. This is because figure skating itself is an exercise that can never be done without the support of strong physical strength. If an individual, such as a professional athlete exercises often, they will naturally gain muscles.The same goes for Kim Yuna, who boasts a slimmer figure than any other ordinary person. Her muscles are not overly large but are prominent enough to be seen.¬†

Recently, one netizen made a post on an online community saying that ""Kim Yuna's muscles are erased from an advertisement."" The netizen made the post express their disappointment that Kim Yuna's muscles that symbolize her hard work were hidden in the photo.





The netizen posted an advertisement photo of a sports brand and compared the photos of Kim Yuna before the edits were made. In the edited photo, her legs are visibly slimmed down removing all her calf muscles.The netizen who made the post stated, ""A figure skater is an athlete as well no matter how thin they are. Therefore, an athlete is bound to have muscles. Kim Yuna is the number 1 athlete in her field of sports so it is natural that she has those muscles. She is still maintaining her figure even after her retirement,""¬†and expressed his dissatisfaction¬†with the photo edit.Netizens who came across the post also agreed and stated, ""I think the photo would have been more impactful if they left her muscles"", ""When I saw the ad, I thought she had fewer muscles than I thought.

She looks pretty with or without muscles.""One netizen stated,¬†""I think it's more important to have these photos unedited because an athlete is taking photos for a sports brand so why would her muscles be edited out?

In the episode of TV Chosun's¬†'Flavor of Wife' that aired on the 27th of last month, Ham So Won and her husband Jin Hua was seen scurrying to bring their daughter to the hospital.



Their daughter, Hye Jung, was not feeling well in the morning and refused to eat any food. When Jin Hua measured her temperature, she had a fever of 39.5 degrees Celsius (103.1 degrees Fahrenheit). Rather than taking their daughter to the hospital right away, Ham So Won and Jin Hua argued whether to take Hye Jung to the hospital or not.



While Jin Hua wanted to take their daughter to the hospital, Ham So Won decided to use a home remedy to lower the fever. Netizens heavily criticized Ham So Won for deciding not to take her daughter to the hospital when she had such a high fever.



Ultimately, the two decided to bring Hye Jung to the hospital. However, Ham So Won was more heavily criticized when she began arguing with her husband at the hospital.

When the two went to register their daughter, the nurse asked for Hye Jung's resident registration number. However, Ham So Won couldn't remember her daughter's registration number. Therefore, Ham So Won asked Jin Hua to get the diary in which the number was written.¬†



Unfortunately, Jin Hua didn't bring the proper diary, so the two argued in public. The two were heavily criticized for their actions as netizens stated they were not acting properly in a public area, especially with their sick daughter.



However,¬† one netizen posted on an online community stating that she was there at the hospital when the whole incident occurred.



The netizen stated that she had gone to the same hospital for her child's regular check-up. When the netizen arrived at the hospital, she noticed that there were cameras set up.

The netizen stated that she saw Ham So Won and Jin Hua talking about their daughter having a high fever. However, what the netizen found odd was that they could not see the doctor because they didn't know their daughter's resident registration number. The netizen revealed that with the parents' consent, the hospital can easily search the registration number rather than having the sick child wait.



The netizen also pointed out that their daughter didn't seem as sick as she was calm and looking around in curiosity. The netizen just thought they were at the hospital because their daughter just had a light cold.¬†



When the netizen saw Ham So Won and Jin Hua argue, she just felt they were overreacting because they were filming.

Earlier this week, the Seoul District Court disclosed the names of former trainees of Mnet's 'Produce' series who were victimized by the broadcasting station, Ahn Joon Young PD, and Kim Yong Bum CP.¬†



According to the court, trainees Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Hye Rim were eliminated through vote manipulation on season 1; trainees Sung Hyun Woo and Kang Dong Ho were eliminated through vote manipulation on season 2; Lee Kaeun and Han Cho Won on season 3; and Anzardi Timothee, Kim Kook Heon, Lee Jin Woo, Goo Jung Mo, Lee Jin Hyuk, and Geum Dong Hyun on season 4. Among these trainees, Kang Dong Ho, Lee Kaeun, Han Cho Won, Goo Jung Mo, Lee Jin Hyuk, and Geum Dong Hyun were listed as trainees who would have made it into the debut lineup during the final voting round of their seasons.¬†







In light of the news shocking the entertainment industry as well as numerous fans and viewers, representatives of K-Pop entertainment companies have commented on the situation, as well as some of the frustrations and dilemmas imposed. One rep from an agency of a victimized trainee said, ""We are disappointed, but at the same time, we question whether there's anything more we can do about it than to just say that this is the reality of the entertainment industry. We were done wrong without any strength to fight back, but as far as we can tell, there's nothing visibly different [with the names revealed].""



Another company rep remarked, ""Since the opposing party is a large broadcasting station, it's uncomfortable to convey our honest thoughts and statements. The agency must also take into consideration that we not only represent the victimized trainee, but we have¬†other label artists to promote. It's not necessarily that CJ ENM is pressuring other companies to keep quiet, but more that most entertainment companies wish to minimize any internal disputes with CJ ENM as much as possible. The fact that the names of the victimized trainees was revealed can be applied as a good thing, but in the long term, companies are still in a position where they must continue to work and¬†negotiate with the large broadcasting station.""







Another rep additionally disclosed, ""It's true that news of such a systematic manipulation comes across as very shocking, but in the first place, we knew that there would be some discrimination regarding screen time, and that the production crew had certain images they wanted for the show. If Mnet tries to resume trainee audition programs again, most companies will have no choice but to send their trainees on it [for fame and relevance].""¬†

Finally, an industry insider added on, ""This issue should not end simply with this 'compensation' that Mnet promised to the victimized trainees, but the broadcasting station must work to ensure that they receive certain treatment which assures their future activities, and these negotiations must consist of visible actions which viewers can confirm. Now that the names of the trainees have been revealed, this is no longer a two-sided matter between Mnet and the victims.""","16","96%"

"433","Netizens angered after Melon labeled K-Pop groups as J-Pop"," haydn-an","Recently, Melon, South Korea's largest music streaming platform, has been under fire¬†for labeling K-Pop groups under ""J-Pop."" Currently, Melon displays the genre 'J-Pop' under K-Pop artists such as BTS, BLACKPINK, TWICE, and Seventeen.¬†According to the online platform on November 29th, any K-Pop artist who has a history of activities or promotions in Japan will be labeled under J-Pop on Melon music despite the group or artist being K-pop singers.

The profile for the globally popular K-Pop group BTS shows the genres listed as ""Group| Rap/Hip-Hop, J-POP, Dance"" displayed on the first page of the ""artist"" menu. This goes for BLACKPINK, TWICE, Seventeen, TXT, and more. The K-Pop groups are listed under J-POP only on Melon music. Genie Music, Bugs Music, FLO, and Vibe do not have these artists¬†listed under this genre. Google's YouTube also does not classify these artists under J-Pop either.

Melon explained that the label does not distinguish the genres but is being used to mark which artists have been active in Japan and sold albums in Japan. They explained, ""The labels are not a distinction between genres but to mark the artists who have released albums in Japan. The artists' detailed information marks they are from Korea.""



Still, there are many who state that listing the K-pop groups with global popularity such as BTS, BLACKPINK, and TWICE as J-pop is ""too much."" Many are concerned that these Korean singers who are promoting K-Pop could be recognized and focused only on the Japanese activities they have done.¬†Many in the music industry are saying that it is difficult to classify the Japanese albums released by the K-Pop groups as J-Pop even if they have released the album in Japan and performed in Japan. If the artist has only released an album in Japan exclusively, then it can be labeled as J-Pop but it can cause confusion and misunderstanding if the genre is displayed prominently on the front page of the artists' information. This is especially so for Melon because Melon also marks Japanese artists under J-Pop. For this reason, other music streaming sites do not mark ""J-Pop"" for Korean artists.Upon hearing the news that ""J-Pop"" was listed on K-Pop artists' information, there were many fans who expressed their anger.Fans protested on Twitter and other social networking sites along with online communities. One BTS fan wrote on Twitter ""Just because a foreign song is popular in Korea doesn't make that song a K-Pop. We don't even need an explanation from Melon, we just need a correction from them.""

Another netizen wrote ""So Melon put in J-Pop in the front profile for the artists.¬†Isn't it wrong to write on the artists' profile category that they are J-Pop just because they released albums in Japan? They are Korean artists.""Netizens are more sensitive towards this issue because of China's 'Northeast Project' and Google's 'Sea of Japan' issue. Recently, there has been controversy as Chinese netizens began claiming the Korean Hanbok as Chinese. This caused the Chinese mobile game 'Shining Nikki' to discontinue their services in Korea.

Experts also warned that the controversy over the labeling K-Pop artists under J-Pop¬†could have an unexpectedly strong impact. For example, there is a possibility that Korean artists participating in the ""2020 Mnet Asian Music Awards"" (MAMA), which will be held on the 2nd of next month, maybe mistaken as representing the J-Pop genre. Some say that BTS's performance, which was nominated for the 63rd Grammy Awards ""Best POP Duo and Group Performance,"" could also be undervalued due to related issues.An official from the pop culture community stated, ""It¬†is surprising that Melon, which is a service that represents domestic Korean music streaming platforms, has labeled K-Pop artists under¬†J-Pop. In particular, Melon is preparing for the Melon Music Awards so they need to seriously consider the related issues.""","22","77%"

"507","[ALBUM & MV REVIEW] Taemin - 'Never Gonna Dance Again: Act 2'"," LorraineYe","[This review reflects the opinions of the author and not necessarily those of allkpop.]



Track List:

1. IDEA¬†

2. Heaven

3. Impressionable

4. Be Your Enemy

5. Think Of You

6. Exclusive - Korean Version

7. Pansy

8. I Think It's Love

9. Identity



My number one concern whenever I see a Taemin comeback is, how in the world can Taemin top what he came out with in the past? Is it even humanly possible for Taemin to become an even better performer and artist? Luckily, the¬†3rd album in his series,¬†Never Gonna Dance Again: Act 2, confirms that Taemin is an artist with unstoppable range and capability and is one of K-Pop's most luminary artists to date. ""IDEA"" is the album's title track and opening. The song is absolutely haunting and chill-inducing.¬†""IDEA"" has perfect balance with the lilt of the instrumental against Taemin's wispy vocal delivery. The song is perfection as a single and a perfect follow-up to ""Criminal.""





The album continues to impress with the track, ""Heaven."" Immediately we are met with angelic riffs eliciting the same goosebumps as before. Taemin's vocals are intentional and give the song a haunting, impressive, and impactful feeling. This eerie feeling continues with ""Impressionable,"" a song that feels like a villain's theme song in a movie. Mysterious, eerie, and with a certain rhythm that gives the song a club feel, the song is a midtempo hit.



""Be Your Enemy"" is the album's only collaboration and features WENDY from Red Velvet. The song is nostalgic in vibe, reminiscent of the late 80s, early 90s.¬†WENDY's part is brief, but her voice is so complementary to Taemin's that it is a welcomed addition to the song. Typically, I'm rather wary of collaborations, but I earnestly believe she is a welcomed addition to the song.

""Think Of You"" is upbeat and starkly different from the first half of the album and marks a bit of a difference in sound. The song shows off¬†Taemin's range well but isn't my favorite on the album for the excessive autotune usage and the fact that some¬†of the vocals double as synths.



Fans of¬†Taemin's Japanese releases will be happy to hear he has released ""Exclusive"" in Korean. The song in Korean is just as good as the original, if not better, and more refined. I¬†can imagine this song going over really well once live tours pick back up.¬†



Taemin slows it down for the last couple of tracks with ""Pansy,"" ""I¬†Think It's Love,"" and ""Identity."" ""Pansy"" is acoustic and downtempo in a delicate sort of way that is distinctly Taemin. About 2/3 of the way into the song, the high notes, in particular, are impeccably done. ""I¬†Think It's Love"" is another ballad, but it's softer and more delicate than the track prior. Taemin's vocals are akin to a thin layer of ice threatening to shatter. The way the song picks up at the chorus and is so impactful that it leaves a powerful impression off just one listen.¬†¬†



The album finishes off with ""Identity,"" a midtempo track that starts slow but feels purposeful in its build-up. The song is well-crafted and gives the album a finale of sorts. The instrumental style ties up this intricate and insanely powerful album with a bow.



MV REVIEW

Taemin will not disappoint on visuals and has never disappointed with his MVs. His video for ""IDEA"" is mesmerizing, intriguing, and visually appealing. The stark contrast between the imagery as it goes with the fluctuations of the song is well-connected and thoughtful. As one artist among many dancers, it's hard to stand out, but even in monochromatic white, Taemin shines as a star. His choreography is over the top and distinctly him: a culmination of K-Pop's greatest concepts and ideas in one.

JB: ""I think it is those small¬†moments of liberty and leisure that come in times of difficulty. Everyone struggles in life, living is never an easy task. But in that life, to be able to cherish and relish¬†just a moment of respite moves me and gives me strength.""

Mark:¬†""These days, my dog Milo makes me happy, just by looking at him.""

Jackson: ""I think that I¬†am able to go on breathing because of our fans.""

Jinyoung: ""I think for me, it's the process of¬†working on music. Of course I also love performing and showing the world our music, but every moment that I¬†spent working on this album, I had a lot of fun. I think this time around, working on our album gave me the strength to breathe on.""

Youngjae: ""My family, my dog Coco, and IGOT7.""

BamBam: ""Of course it's IGOT7.""

Yugyeom: ""IGOT7, my family, and my friends.""



Q: In your opinion, what is romantic?



JB: ""I¬†think to be romantic is to respect others, whether it's a lover or just others you have a relationship with in general.¬†Maybe how much you think of that person is important.""

Mark: ""I think it's those moments when you feel an unknown sort of happiness just by being together, even though no one is saying anything. It's similar to when we are with our fans.""

Jinyoung: ""For me, being romantic is responding to any situation smoothly.""

Youngjae: ""I think that it is romantic to buy flowers and nice clothes for my mother, since she is also a woman.""

BamBam: ""You can experience romantic feelings from anyone, from their specific charms. I¬†think that honest actions are the most romantic.""



Q: What are some hobbies you want to suggest to your fans?



JB: ""These days, I'm into animation, so I want to suggest watching animation.""

Mark:¬†""There are so many good games these days. I¬†want to suggest some games fans can play together.""

Jinyoung: ""I¬†want to suggest swimming. It is a difficult sport, but you are so focussed on moving that you can't think of anything else.""

Youngjae: ""Building blocks. I don't have time to do it as often these days but it really makes you focus and erases those extra thoughts.""

BamBam:¬†""I am into exercise these days. I want to work out with our fans.""","9","93%"

Residents of the city of Daegu are increasingly growing concerned about the '2020 SBS Gayo Daejeon in Daegu', coming up next month.¬†



Due to the resurgence of COVID19 cases in various regions across South Korea, many regions such as Seoul has reinstated stricter social distancing stages and guidelines. The city of Daegu is widely known as a ""model example""¬†of how people should react when COVID19 becomes widespread. Back in March of this year, after a breakout of the virus in the city, residents responded with decisive measures to snuff out further spreading and also reacted diligently in handling COVID19 patients.¬†



Meanwhile, SBS has decided that the '2020 Gayo Daejeon' will take place this year on December 25 in partnership with the city of Daegu, as a way to promote the city to global K-Pop fans worldwide. The event will be held entirely online without any audiences; however, many city residents are still concerned that fans will still make the trip to Daegu to see their favorite K-Pop artists close up.¬†



So far, the '2020 SBS Gayo Daejeon' has confirmed BTS as the first headlining artist of its lineup. In addition, the event is expected to announce approximately 20 artists in early December, ahead of the full show on Christmas day. One Daegu resident commented, ""Other regions in the area are currently experiencing sharp peaks in COVID19 cases, and if these people come to Daegu, I'm worried that the nightmare we faced in March will reoccur. I have a feeling that even if they can't attend the actual show, fans will still crowd in places where their artists are expected to visit and travel, just to get a glimpse of the celebrities' faces up close.""¬†



The location of the '2020 SBS Gayo Daejeon in Daegu' is also currently being kept private to prevent any fans from attempting to see their artists, but many K-Pop fans know that sasaengs have a way of finding out where their artists will be at all times.¬†



A representative from the city of Daegu's tourism department relayed, ""It's not easy to host BTS in the Daegu region. Tourist attraction and promotion of the city are two things we cannot let go of, and if this upcoming show is broadcast worldwide, it may become a starting point for rejuvenating the tourism industry after the [COVID19] situation dies down. They are keeping the number of attending artists to a minimum and seeking variety, and we will also employee the help of police and safety patrols if necessary to ensure that civilians do not attempt to approach the event venue.""¬†","13","78%"

In celebration of their Grammy nomination, let's take a walk down memory lane for this Throwback¬†and enjoy the most-viewed vintage¬†Simply K-Pop performances of BTS!



6. I Need U - 1.9M views

""I NEED U"" was a legendary release that helped to garner a lot of attention and new fans for the group.¬†The song is an urban-style electronic hip hop song and depicts a sense of loss when the passionate love he's been experiencing has begun fading away. This performance marks a turning point for the group's popularity. ""I NEED U"" comes in at number 6 with 1.9M¬†views.



5. Danger - 2.1M views

Though ""Danger"" actually came out prior to ""I NEED U,"" this powerful performance actually has more views than ""I NEED U""! ""Danger""¬†came out 14 months after the group's debut and was a change in sound and energy. The song showcased the group's ability to break out of the standard box with a hybrid hip hop beat and punk rock guitar sound. Don't play games with BTS heart!



4.¬†War of Hormone - 2.4M views

Released alongside ""Danger,"" ""War of Hormone"" was the group's high-powered song that¬†showed a sexier side to the then-growing group. Following the lead of ""Danger,"" ""War of Hormone"" also has a hip hop beat and rock guitar instrumental that conveys the lyricism of getting nervous and¬†having your heart beat faster in front of your love interest. The boys are seen here in this performance in the same outfits as their MV, showing a playful dance choreography.



3.¬†Boy In Luv - 3.2M view

The cardinal BTS classic - ""Boy In Luv."" This vintage BTS performance is an amazing blast from the past. From Jungkook's tiny stature to the popular vintage dance styles in the era, this performance is a treat to watch. Jungkook stands at a mere 16 years old and Jin in this era is 21. It's insane to think about how far the group has come from this performance. Could you have foreshadowed that they would be Grammy-nominated in 2020 based on this ""Boy In Luv"" stage?



2. DOPE - 10M views

The choreography for ""DOPE"" was one of BTS's most-challenging at the time, and it paid off to dance their hearts out!¬†The last most-viewed performance for ""Boy In Luv"" only had 3.2M views, but ""DOPE"" has 10M! This really marks a moment in the shift in their popularity, as they showcased one of the most memorable choreographies of that year. Every fan was doing this dance, with some even zealously cosplaying as one of the member's costumes from the MV.



1. Boyz With Fun - 20M views

One of the most recognizable performance choreographies¬†and¬†the most-viewed video out of all their Simply K-Pop performances is ""Boyz With Fun."" This super playful song is a narrative for the group, and the song¬†brought lots of unadulterated joy to ARMY due to its¬†upbeat tempo and feel. The title is literal- and showcases the boys being full of fun and youthful energy.

Netizens were completely bombarded with a mixture of different emotions as they watched EXO member Kai's solo debut MV!



As many of you know, EXO member Kai made his solo debut on November 30 with the release of his ""Mmmh"" MV. The mesmerizing MV enraptured fans for the duration of a little over 3 minutes. But once the MV came to an end and Kai brought the adventure to a close with an epic rooftop scene, SM Entertainment dropped a new spoiler at the end!



In this short spoiler clip (starts ~ 3:15), a floating rock drops down onto a mysterious field. The rock then cracks and breaks, revealing a chunk of ice. The ice, when it meets the terrain, turns everything in its vicinity into ice. The camera then fades out as the chunk of ice reveals two very familiar symbols!







Longtime fans of EXO will recognize the two symbols in the ice as the superpower symbols belonging to EXO members D.O. and Xiumin. After recognizing the symbols, fans also pieced together that the rock was cracked and broken through D.O's superpower of strength, and the ice chunk froze everything in its vicinity through Xiumin's superpower of ice.¬†



Simply put, SM Entertainment is teasing fans in light of the fact that D.O. and Xiumin will be returning from their mandatory military service duties soon!

That's how she began playing table tennis and even became the national athlete of Korea.¬†After, Seo Hyo Won became famous for being known as the pretty table tennis player in Korea.



In this episode, the table tennis athlete talked about the difficult times she had while she was training to become the national athlete for Korea. In 2006, when she was a senior in High School, she was diagnosed with a back disk and was distraught thinking her life as an athlete was over. However, after one year of rehabilitation, she was able to make a successful comeback.



Yet, things didn't get better. Another ordeal came to the young athlete in 2008. The table tennis team that she had joined had to disband due to financial difficulty. Seo Hyo Won had no other teams to go to since she was not able to make the World's¬†Top 100 Athletes list. However, the legendary tennis player Hyun Jung Hwa gave Seo Hyo Won a chance to go on the world tour together.

¬†

Through this chance, Seo Hyo Won was able to participate in the Korea Open Table Tennis Championship in 2011. Seo Hyo Won made headlines at the time as she won against Ishikawa Kasumi, during the 32nd round between Korea and Japan. She had also gained much attention for her pretty looks and exceptional skills.

However, Seo Hyo Won gained even more attention from China rather than Korea since table tennis sports were more popular in China. Seo Hyo Won was selected as a member of the national team in 2013 and made her name known in China as she became the ace in the national team.



China also took interest in her appearance and for her beauty as various pictorials of the athlete spread across Weibo. In China, she became known as the 'Table Tennis Goddess'.



In 2015, Seo Hyo Won was also featured on the cover of the¬†popular male magazine, Maxim Magazine. She even became the model for a coffee brand at that time.



Making her first Olympic appearance at the age of 30, Seo Hyo Won is still active as a table tennis player currently, at the age of 34. Seo Hyo Won stated she never regretted becoming an athlete but regrets not spending more time with her father who died of cancer.","11","80%"

On November 19th, Nancy Lang held a press conference for her first exhibition, 'Scarlet Fairy' at Jinshan Gallery in Mapo-gu, Seoul. She stated that her exhibit contains ""a positive and happy message from the fairies who fight and heal the women and people who are suffering around the world.""



During the press conference, she also revealed the reason why she decided to hold the exhibit and make a comeback as an artist. She stated, ""When I was going through something personal, I heard the news that Sulli and Hara went through a hard time and took their own lives. It really hurt my heart. I also went through difficult times that I almost killed myself too. And I know those choices could have been prevented if someone was by their side at that moment.""

Nancy Lang then continued to state, ""At the difficult times, I went over and lived with a close friend of mine who is the CEO of a movie production company. I lived with her for two months, so I was able to avoid making that extreme choice.""She stated, ""I know it's hard for people or celebrities to pull themselves together when they go through hard times. Fortunately, I was able to overcome that part of my life because I believed in myself and had faith in my art. So I want to comfort and treat people who are suffering through my work that has a positive message and colorful composition.""Both Sulli and Hara made an extreme choice to take their own life in 2019. Many were saddened to hear the tragic news of the two idols, who were known to be best friends.

Fans began becoming skeptical as to if the label will be¬†fulfilling all of this year's promised comebacks but to many fans' relief, most of the YG artists made a comeback as they promised.



Yet, while almost all the comebacks were fulfilled as they stated, there is one artist who has not made a comeback. Kang Seung Yoon's fans were promised a solo album from the artist by the fall season of this year. Still, there hasn't been any news of the album release from the artist, therefore, some fans have set up a protest truck in front of the YG Entertainment company building.¬†



Fans have also taken it to online communities to express their disappointment and also take the time to explain why they are angered. One fan posted explaining that YG Entertainment has been promising to release Kang Seung Yoon's solo album since 2013. However, due to various reasons, the album release was delayed. Then in 2018, YG Entertainment stated that Kang Seung Yoon's album is almost ready and is near completion, but for some reason, the album was still not released by then.



Now, in 2020 during the summer, YG Entertainment stated that Kang Seung Yoon is planning to release his solo album by the fall of this year. As the autumn season passed and the year is coming to an end, fans still haven't heard any news about the artist's solo album.

""I'm part of a different fandom but I do admit Kang Seung Yoon is really good at singing and hope he gets his solo album. I was amazed by his singing in the audition program.""

Netizens have once again spotted a hint for aespa's debut seen in another SM¬†music video.



On November 16, SM Entertainment's new girl group unveiled their MV teaser for ""Black Mamba"". In the teaser, a scene features a large basilisk entering a naturalistically decorated¬†subway train.

This discovery of the spoiler¬†drew¬†mixed responses from the netizens, as some applauded SM for their creativity while others expressed disappointment.¬†



Some comments include, ""Instead of this, why didn't you just have an aespa member make a guest appearance in NCT U's MV? Like as a genie who brings in the lamp or something..."", ""Y'all, NCT used similar tactics too, before their own debut"", ""Um...no...neither NCT nor any of the other artists in SM did this..."", ""SM is starting this new concept where all the artists share the same universe; it's called SM Culture Universe where the storytelling continues from group to group.""







Previously, certain fans of Super M have¬†also expressed disappointment for incorporating aespa in their MV. While some are open to the idea of having the conceptual worlds collide, others still¬†remain doubtful about the positives in using particular¬†groups and their fandom power¬†to promote other artists.



Other comments include:



""The problem is that NCT U fans thought that the subway scene was a spoiler for their own comeback, not some embedded preview for a different group""

""It's the same company...they can do whatever they want""

""I don't think there's a problem with this??""

""I think they are both correct -- it's a marketing tactic as well as a creative mode to have their worlds collide""

"757","Did BTS basically confirm the ""Spring Day"" theory?"," haydn-an","On November 23rd, Esquire Magazine published an interview with BTS.¬†



BTS spoke about various topics starting from their take on society's definition of masculinity to their unexpected world domination. Many fans ecstatically read through BTS's interview and could not help but drop their mouths when BTS mentioned the theory behind their popular song ""Spring Day.""





When BTS released ""Spring Day,"" it was three years after the tragic Sewol Ferry incident. In 2014, a class of high school students was on a school trip on a ferry when the tragedy occurred. The incident was broadcasted on the News as citizens of Korea watched the ferry slowly sinking into the ocean. When the incident occurred, many Koreans were confused as to why the rescue operation¬†took too long.

¬†

On this horrific day, 304 people died, with most of the deaths being the young students who were told to stay in their cabins as the boat was engulfed in the water. This was the event that brought light to the administration of President Park Geun Hye.¬†



After the incident, many entertainers who spoke about the incident and spoke against the government were blacklisted and excluded from government support. The commemorative yellow ribbons of the tragic incident were banned in school by the Ministry of Education.¬†



BTS being the idol group known to express their ideology and opinions of society and never shying away from the controversial political subjects, many fans speculated that BTS's ""Spring Day"" alluded to the Sewol Ferry incident.¬†¬†



First, fans related the song to the Ferry incident as the tragedy occurred in Spring. Also, BTS released concept photos with yellow writing on a black background when making a comeback reminding the fans of the yellow ribbons to commemorate the Sewol victims.



 Also, in the music video, member Jimin is seen in front of the sea holding a pair of sneakers. The Sewol Ferry sank in the ocean, but the shoes of the victims were left on the harbor along with yellow ribbons with messages to them.



Many continued their speculations as BTS made donations to the victims after the incident. Three years have passed since the song was released and Jin confirmed that the song was referencing a sad incident. He stated, ""It is about a sad event, as you said, but it is also about longing.""



Despite the government's censorship and the risk of being placed on the blacklist, BTS was able to deliver the message through the song. After the interview with Esquire Magazine¬†was released, fans were in goosebumps to realize the detailed complexity in BTS songs and were once again amazed by the group.





My jaw is on the floor oh my god

I KNOW ! I was surprised too! but tbh i was happy that they answered but the last line was not them , that was the writer but i am glad that they could talk about it honestly all the time ppl think spring day is about losing friends it is but it also mainly about the ferry +

Not the song led to the impeachment but the event itself, Sewel-ho worked as a catalyst. There are a lot of problems happening during that time. Park has been criticized being late for rescue and causing 304 people died and mostly are students on their school trip.

"795","Korean Air is looking to acquire Asiana Airlines"," haydn-an","As Hanjin Group, which owns Korean Air, is reportedly seeking to acquire Asiana Airlines, attention is being drawn to whether a mega national airline will be created.



If the acquisition is successful, a monopoly will be formed as the two ""top"" airlines will join under Korean Air. However, the acquisition process will take a considerable amount of time to complete due to Asiana Airline's high debt and opposition from the labor unions.



On November 13,¬†Korean Air maintains a cautious stance on the acquisition of Asiana Airlines as they state¬†nothing has been confirmed.¬†Although Korean Air is cautious with their¬†words, the industry and the government already expect Hanjin Group's acquisition process of Asiana Airlines to begin soon.



The government is expected to hold a meeting of the related ministries to strengthen industrial competitiveness as early as the 16th of this month¬†and officially announce Hanjin Group's acquisition of Asiana Airlines at the governmental¬†level.Korean Air is also said to be willing to take over Asiana Airlines as it has been discussing with the Korea Development Bank for several months.If Korean Air acquires Asiana Airlines, the airline company will rise to be a top 10 airline globally.According to the ""World Air Transport Statistics 2020"" published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Korean Air ranked 18th and Asiana Airlines 32nd in the global airline ranking based on the international passenger RPK (the number of floating passengers per flight multiplied by the flight distance).



If Korean Air and Asiana Airlines are combined, they will be similar to American Airlines, ranking 10th place.

In terms of the number of international passengers, Korean Air ranked 19th and Asiana Airlines ranked 36th, but they will rise to rank ten once the two airlines are combined.In the international freight traffic rankings, Korean Air (5th) and Asiana Airlines (23rd) combined can beat Cathay Pacific in third place.Considering the number of aircraft owned by Korean Air alone after the merger, there will be a total of 249 planes, including¬†the current number of aircraft owned by Korean Air (164 aircraft) and¬†Asiana Airlines (79 aircraft). This would be in line with Air France (220 aircraft) and Lufthansa (280 aircraft), among the top ten ranks in airline aircraft ownership.The share of domestic passengers will amount to around half the market share if the subsidiaries are added together. At the end of last year, Korean Air had a 22.9 percent share, and Asiana Airlines had a 19.3 percent share. The combined market share of low-cost carriers (LCCs) of Jin Air, Air Busan, and Air Seoul amounts to 62.5 percent.As of last year, the combined revenue of Korean Air (12.6834 trillion KRW) and Asiana Airlines (2.18 trillion KRW) amounted to 15 trillion KRW (~13.6 Billion USD).In addition, it is expected that costs will be reduced by unifying maintenance and pilot education, and profitability will improve by simplifying redundant routes.¬†However, the situation in the airline industry, which is difficult due to the coronavirus infection (COVID19), and opposition from internal employees are expected to hamper the acquisition process.Korean Air said it posted a surplus for the second consecutive quarter, but a ""big deal"" could be a burden at a time when sales fell to 90% compared to last year in the aftermath of COVID19.



In particular, some insiders oppose the takeover itself, as Asiana Airlines' debt ratio reached 2,291 percent in the second quarter of this year, and its debt volume exceeded 12 trillion KRW (~10.8 Billion¬†USD).Korean Air, which is scheduled to apply for a key industrial stabilization fund from the government to overcome the liquidity crisis caused by the COVID19, will also run into issues while raising funds to take over Asiana Airlines.



As a result, the Korea Development Bank is considering investing funds in Hanjin Korean Airline, the holding company of Hanjin Group, through a third-party allocated capital increase. Hanjin KAL is considering buying a 30.77 percent stake in Asiana Airlines owned by Kumho Industrial.

Back in April of this year, YouTuber Kim Soo Dal posted a video with the title ""Asiana employee who really has something to tell Woo Sung Jung."" In the video, she had invited a co-worker who wanted to share the story about the encounter she had with the actor over twenty years ago.¬†



As many know, flight attendants are able to have the perks of meeting celebrities during their work as celebrities travel around the world. Kim Soo Dal invited her coworker, a flight attendant at Asiana Airlines. The flight attendant began the story by saying she had to guide a first-class¬†guest to the gate. She said it was her first time bringing a first-class guest to the gate, so instead of getting on the flight first, she brought him over to the economy guest line and had him wait behind all the other passengers. That first-class guest happened to be actor Jung Woo Sung.





Rather than getting mad, Jung Woo Sung just smiled and asked, ""Are you new?""¬†then he patiently waited in line for fifteen minutes¬†until everyone boarded. As he was getting into the airplane, he kindly greeted the flight attendant, ""Thank you, I'll travel well.""¬†The flight attendant did not know what she had done wrong but was rebuked by her supervisors. When the supervisors apologized to Jung Woo¬†Sung about the mistake, he made no complaints and said he was able to arrive safely thanks to the flight attendant.

The video ended with the flight attendant leaving a video message for the actor, thanking him for his kindness.","2","89%"
